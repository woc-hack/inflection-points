    Changepoints are when statistical properties of time series change.\\

\begin{frame}{Research Questions}
    Exploratory Research Questions:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item How common are changepoints in open source project activity?
        \item What are the signs and magnitudes of changes at changepoints?
    \end{enumerate}
    \vskip 3 mm
    Future Research Questions:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Can we identify changepoints that indicate project events?
        \item Can we find changepoint patterns indicative of lifecycles?
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Data Collection}
World of Code is an archive of 120+ million git repositories.\\
\vskip 5 mm
Selected projects that met the following criteria from WoC:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item At least 48 months between the first and last commit.
        \item At least 5000 commits.
        \item At least 50 authors.
    \end{itemize}
\vskip 3 mm
We found 8,919 projects that met these criteria.
\end{frame}

% Talking points:
%    * 99.6% have changepoints (32 projects do not)
%    * Median number of changepoints is 3
%    * 90% have between one and six changepoints.
%    * 27 projects have 10 or more changepoints
%
\begin{frame}{Projects by Number of Changepoints in Commits}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,keepaspectratio]{commit-changepoints.pdf}
\end{frame}

% We found a total of 31,416 changepoints in project commit
%    * 49% (15,342) were increases in commit activity 
%    * 51% (16,047) were reductions in activity. 
% We computed the magnitude of a changepoint as the difference in 
% means in the number of monthly commits before and after the
% changepoint. 
%
% The size of most changes were relatively small
%    * IQR ranges between -75 to 87 commits per month
% Some outliers are very large as can be seen long tails in figure.

\begin{frame}{Conclusions and Future Work}
    Conclusions:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Over 99\% of open source projects with extensive history have changepoints.
        \item Increases and decreases in project activity occur in roughly equal shares (51\% vs 49\%).
        \item Majority of changepoints range from -75 to 87 commits/month, but there are a number of huge outliers.
    \end{itemize}

    % Future Work:
    % \begin{itemize}
    %     \item Identify changepoint patterns, with a goal of finding lifecycle models.
    %     \item Determine the impact of external events like COVID-19 on open source evolution.
    %     \item Examine changepoints in static code metrics.
